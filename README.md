# Advent_of-_Code-2025
This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**.
I worked on the challenges for **12 days** as part of my regular coding practice.

Each day is stored in a separate folder with:
- the solution code
- the input file used for that problem

The focus was on solving the problems correctly and improving problem-solving skills,
rather than writing the most optimized or shortest code.

## Progress
Completed solutions for Days **1–12**.

## Notes
This repository is meant for learning and practice.
There are often multiple ways to solve the same problem, and these are my own approaches.
